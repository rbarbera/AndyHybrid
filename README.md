# AndyHybrid
A strait forward yet powerful Hybrid development platform for Android. AndyHybrid provides you with what you need to develop installable apps in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 without being difficult and using large amounts of RAM and CPU time.

This example/template is build for Android 6 (Marshmallow). It can readily be modified to work for earlier versions of Android.



Other libraries, such as appache cordova/phoneGap, are bloated. They include old code required to support much older environments. The vast majority of Hybrid development projects don't need those complicated, large libraries. AndyHybrid, and its iOS twin SwiftlyHybrid, are more than sufficient.
