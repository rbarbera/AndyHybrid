# AndyHybrid
A strait forward yet powerful Hybrid development platform for Android. AndyHybrid provides you with what you need to develop installable apps in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 without being difficult and using large amounts of RAM and CPU time.

This example/template is build for Android 6 (Marshmallow). It can readily be modified to work for earlier versions of Android.
